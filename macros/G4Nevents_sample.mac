#
#Set the Run Period, default is -999 which is no run period at all. MUST SET IT.
#Run Period 0 is like a "default" run period, everything is aligned, it is not
#specific to any ACTUAL NuMI beam running period.

#Use the Calibration corrected horn current value for the
#horn current configuration defined by BeamConfig (see next), default is true
#Note:This must be set BEFORE setting BeamConfig

#Configure the neutirno beam. 
#This sets the TargetZ0 and Baffle Z0 and HornCurrent.
#Must be in the form \"LE#z#i\" or \"le#z#i\", where # is any number. 
#Examples are le010z185i, LE025.3z-200i, LE250z185.6i....etc.
#Note: cannot handle ME config right now.

# If NOT using an external hadron file then this establishes how 
# many particles(protons) to use during the simulation. To be consistent 
# with past neutrino ntuples each run uses 500000 protons

#NOTE: To debug problems grep for "PROBLEM" in the output of the simulation

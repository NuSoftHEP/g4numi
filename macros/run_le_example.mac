#
#Configure the neutirno beam. 
#This sets the TargetZ0 and Baffle Z0 and HornCurrent.
#Must be in the form \"LE#z#i\" or \"le#z#i\", where # is any number. 
#Examples are le010z185i, LE025.3z-200i, LE250z185.6i....etc.
#Note: cannot handle ME config right now.
#

#Note: It can only handle the standard horn currents (positive and negative 000,185,200,etc.) 
#and a few I (Bruce) added to study the effects of changed horn currents. Check NumiDataInput.cc
#to see what these horn currents are. The numbers are all 3 digits, but correspond to values
#with more digits! e.g. 187i corresponds to 187.563 kA

#Note: You can allow changes to some beam parameters by typing the lines below. A short description follows.
#/NuMI/det/UseHornMisalign true
#	This allows you to change the horn transverse positions by a number of mm (in x direction).
#	Add ###hot###htt to the end of the beam configuration string below.
#	You may place a "-" in the first # spot to make the transverse position negative
#/NuMI/det/UseTgtDensity true
#	Allows you to change the target density by a number of micrograms per cm^3.
#	Add #######tgd to the end of the beam configuration string below (so 1780000tgd would be 1.78 g/cm^3).
#It's important that you follow the above and enter information in each of the # spots

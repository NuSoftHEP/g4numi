#Set the Run Period, default is -999 which is no run period at all. MUST SET IT.
#Run Period 0 is like a "default" run period, everything is aligned, it is not
#specific to any ACTUAL NuMI beam running period.

#Configure the neutirno beam. 
#This sets the TargetZ0 and Baffle Z0 and HornCurrent.
#Must be in the form \"LE#z#i\" or \"le#z#i\", where # is any number.
